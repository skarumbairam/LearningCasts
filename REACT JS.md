# ================ REACT JS ================

## what is react js & What are the key features of React?

React is an open-source JavaScript library primarily used for building single-page applications (SPAs) and reusable user interface (UI) components. It was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook and a community of developers.

**Key points to add:**

**Component-based Architecture:** React follows a declarative, component-based approach to building UIs, which promotes reusability and maintainability. Components are the building blocks of React applications, and they can be simple or complex, containing their own state, lifecycle methods, and logic.

**Virtual DOM:** One of React's most significant features is the Virtual DOM. It improves performance by rendering changes to a lightweight, in-memory representation of the DOM before making changes to the actual browser DOM. This minimizes costly DOM manipulation, making React faster and more efficient, especially for complex applications.

**JSX (JavaScript XML):** React uses JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript. It makes the code more readable and easier to write, though it's not mandatory. The JSX code is compiled into JavaScript before being executed in the browser.

**State and Props:** React components manage state (internal data) and receive props (external data). State is mutable and local to the component, while props are immutable and passed from parent components to child components.

**Unidirectional Data Flow:** React follows a one-way data flow pattern. Data is passed down from parent components to child components via props. This predictable data flow makes the app easier to understand and debug.

**React Hooks:** Introduced in React 16.8, Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing class-based components. Popular hooks include useState, useEffect, and useContext, making it easier to manage side effects and handle component logic.

**Ecosystem:** React has a rich ecosystem, including routing (React Router), state management (Redux, Context API), and more. It's often paired with libraries and tools like Webpack and Babel to handle bundling and transpiling.

**React Native:** React can also be used to build mobile applications through React Native, which allows developers to write mobile apps using the same React principles and JavaScript, but output native mobile components.

**Community Support:** React has a large and active community. It benefits from constant updates, tutorials, and third-party libraries that extend its functionality.

**Performance Optimization:** React offers performance optimization techniques such as React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to help prevent unnecessary re-renders, especially in large-scale applications.

## What is JSX, and how does it differ from HTML?

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to define the structure of the UI. It looks similar to HTML but can be written inside JavaScript code. JSX allows you to mix HTML-like code with JavaScript, making it easier to define UI elements and their behavior in a more readable and declarative way.

**Key Points:**

JSX is not HTML; it is a JavaScript syntax extension that is later transformed into JavaScript code by tools like Babel.

JSX expressions are wrapped in curly braces {} within the code, allowing dynamic content (e.g., variables, functions) to be embedded in the markup.

JSX must return a single root element, typically a div, section, or a custom React component.

JSX is optional, but it's widely used because it makes React code more readable.

## Explain the difference between functional and class components.?

A React component is a reusable building block of a React application. It is a function or class that returns UI elements (using JSX) based on the data it receives (via props) or its internal state. There are two types:

**Functional Components:** Simpler, defined as JavaScript functions, often using hooks like useState to manage state.

**Class Components:** Older style, defined as ES6 classes, with this.state and lifecycle methods for managing state and handling component lifecycle events.

Components help break down the UI into smaller, manageable parts and allow for reusability across the app. They can be stateless (just displaying UI) or stateful (holding and updating data).

## What are props in React? How are they different from state?

**Props:** Short for "properties," props are read-only inputs passed to a component from its parent. They allow data to flow from parent to child components. Props are immutable and passed from parent to child.

**State:** State is an internal data store within a component that can change over time. It allows components to manage dynamic data and re-render when the data changes. State is mutable and managed within the component itself.
